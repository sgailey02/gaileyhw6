# Hand Gesture Recognition Deep Learning

 This client-server  ML interface will take numerous images of hands consisting mostly in formations of the “rock, paper, scissors” game. This program creates training sets and test sets for each “rock”, “paper”, or “scissor” images to create models. These models are fed into a CNN where we can training them and recognize these images as a “rock”, “paper”, or “scissor” move and the image will be sent back to the client. Uses Tensorflow and Keras.
